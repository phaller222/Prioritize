# Reporting Security Issues

The Prioritize team and community take security bugs in Prioritize seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/phaller222/PrioritizeEJB/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Prioritize team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report if possible. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed 
of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance. 

* PLEASE NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE PROJECT DOES NOT HAVE FULL MANPOWER TO ADDRESS ALL SECURITY ISSUES INSTANTANIOUSLY! IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO FIX!

# Third Party Security Issues

We us dependabot to periodically check our maven dependencies for possible security issues. If you detect a security issue within one of those external modules please report the issue directly to them.
